The webpage, through a fixed panel and tabs, allows users to see the actual situation, the historical data as well as the modeled epidemic curve of the covid19 in Italy. Several models, such as logistic, gomperz and exponential are present. Also, many variables, such as the total/daily infected or the total/daily deaths, daily are considered. Finally, the user can also directly monitor the historical data of the epidemic. Data, which are published on a daily basis by the Italian Health Ministry, are updated automatically.
